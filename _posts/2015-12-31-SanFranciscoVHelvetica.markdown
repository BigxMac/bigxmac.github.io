<p class="intro">Typographically speaking 2015 was huge for Apple. The first type it has made in over 20 years, known as San Francisco (and San Francisco Compact for those checking), was finally shipped to the public found first in the Apple Watch, and later in OSX 10.11 El Capitan, iOS 9, tvOS, and the new keyboards introduced in 2015. Most end-users wont notice the difference, but a typography geek like me completely does.</p>

San Francisco is a neo-grotesque san-serif type fitting in the same category as the previously used Helvetica Neue. Incase you don't work at a type foundry or aren't a typography geek like me let me let me break it down for you. Sans serif fonts are fonts which do not contain serifs. A serif is a line finishing the strokes of a letter. In layman terms they are the little lines that overlap the tips of the letters. Neo-grotesque is a modern design style of type which has evolved from the grotesque style. Again in layman terms just a modern style of type. Apple created the font to address concern and complains made about the readability of Helvetica Neue at small sizes or on non-retina displays (used with OS X).

With readability being the clear goal in mind during the creation of San Francisco the subtile curves of Helvetica in glyphs such as 'G', 'a', '1', and '7' have been replaced with straight lines. It is a bit blockier as well especially in it's compact form (Keeping in mind that it it's purpose is for displays and not print). To describe it in a sentence it is a cross between "Univers" and "Helvetica Neue" optimized for readability. While I still prefer Helvetica Neue the readability at small sizes or on low ppi displays is better. Unfortunately to get there Apple did make a tradeoff. Was it worth it? I believe so.

Early in Apple's history it was at the forefront of digital typography, but in recent years it has slipped with other companies such as Google, and Mozilla creating their own type. It is nice to see Apple creating type once again, and I look foreward to the possibility of them creating more in the future.
