<p class="intro">The goal of this blog is to </p>

share my experiences and thoughts about programming. Some blog posts may blur into productivity or tips I come across. No matter the topic, I promise to keep it interesting and relevant. At the start of this blog you can expect many rapid posts as I have a lot of thoughts brewing being that Google I/O and WWDC, two major developer events, just recently took place. Posts will most likely thin out though over time. Needless to say, bookmark this page and stop by once a week!
