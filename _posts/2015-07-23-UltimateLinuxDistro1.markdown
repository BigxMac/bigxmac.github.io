<p class="intro">I love linux. It's open source and the most customizable OS on the planet. From a purely technical kernel aspect Linux is my favorite OS. Well then why don't I use it?</p>

### Prologue
Before getting a Mac and switching to OS X in August of 2014, I used Linux; Ubuntu (Unity) to be more precise. It was better than Windows and a \*nix OS. I like the ideologies of Linux and what it stands for, but just can't find myself to use it.

### Productivity
I am big on the fact that tools should enhance productivity, not hinder it. Everyone is different and thus what works best for everyone is different. Currently for me it is the Mac. I don't use Windows. It isn't \*nix based and causes me to waste time on pointless tedious things that no end-user should have to deal with. This blog post isn't a rant about Windows however, it is one about me and my quest to find the ultimate Linux distro for me. I like the fact that on my Mac all of the tool bars are at the top. It is one less thing that I have to think about and remember on a per-application basis. Spotlight allows me to quickly launch apps without even touching a mouse, and tools like ShortCat allow me to use the mouse even less. The dock is convent for storing applications I frequently use and gets out of my way when I'm not using it. I like that. If I want to do something then I just do it.


### User Experience
I absolutely love a great user experience. Using a computer should be intuitive, precognitive, and actually a pleasure to use. I am also a perfectionist. I will notice that one pixel that is off or the slightest inconsistency. The UX use has to meet all of these expectations and so far I have not found a Linux desktop that meets them. All are either too complex for everyday use, ugly, or just don't give you the feeling that what you are looking at is meaningful. While I am not huge on the new design of OS X Yosemite it is still the best out there in comparison.

### The Goal of this Blog Series
Ok Jared. You just said that you love Linux and then tore it apart and threw it in the trash. What is the point? The point is that in this blog series I will try to find the Linux distro that works best for me and explain what I do or do not like. If you have any recommendations please leave them in the comments below.  

### What I am looking for in a Distro
The distro I want needs to be beautiful, have good window management, nothing on the desktop, and a way for me to quickly launch applications using only the keyboard or a dock that looks nice and can be hidden. Having the menus in a menubar would be nice, but I can get over it.
