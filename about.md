	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>
	<!-- <img src="/assets/img/touring.jpg" alt=""> -->
	<p class="intro">I am an avid programmer who codes in Java, Python, Objective-C, and (my favorite) Swift.</p>
	<p>I am currently learning Perl, and C++. In the future I would like to learn C, Javascript, and Ruby. Most of my time these days are spent learning more about iOS development, watching computer science lectures, and strengthening my programming skills.</p>
	<h2>Future Goals</h2>
	<ul>
			<li>Become an iPhone App freelancer</li>
			<li>Contribute to more open source projects such as Mozilla and DuckDuckGo</li>
			<li>Create my own font</li>
			<li>Win a WWDC student scholarship and get my photo taken with Chris Lattner</li>
			<li>Submit an iPhone app to the App Store that I am proud of and earns back my $99 investment (to register as a developer with Apple)</li>
			<li>Never stop learning</li>
	</ul>
