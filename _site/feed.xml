        <title>Welcome to My Blog!</title>
        <description>&lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;The goal of this blog is to &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;share my experiences and thoughts about programming. Some blog posts may blur into productivity or tips I come across. No matter the topic, I promise to keep it interesting and relevant. At the start of this blog you can expect many rapid posts as I have a lot of thoughts brewing being that Google I/O and WWDC, two major developer events, just recently took place. Posts will most likely thin out though over time. Needless to say, bookmark this page and stop by once a week! &lt;/p&gt;
